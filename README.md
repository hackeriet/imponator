## TODO
Lessons learned after the test version
- [ ] Remove Silkscreen text from top side. Either delete or move to bottom side.
- [ ] Add useful information to bottom side. Such as link. Or maybe also fun stuff, its free (silkscreen) real estate after all.
- [ ] Add pin 1 indicator to Shitty Add-on header.
- [ ] Add 3 step toggle switch to switch between battery,external battery and USB C
- [ ] Consider adding button(s)
